.cert is a folder which we created. This is the folder where every SSL-related item is stored. It is advised to create this folder beforehand in order for the SLL certificated to be created properly.

The ssl-maker.sh file, which is needed for the generation of the SSL certificate was taken from:
https://gist.github.com/ptvandi/5a33c28d74ccc5100d7fe2bf5de96deb

To enable the SSL certificate we followed the instructions of the official documentation:
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development/#custom-ssl-certificate

Reminder: Since the SSL certificate is self-signed make sure to add it in the 'Ignore' list of the browser, in order for the application to run properly.
