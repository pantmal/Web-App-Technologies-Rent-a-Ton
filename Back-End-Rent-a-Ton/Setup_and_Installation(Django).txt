Reminder: If you want to use the database, it will have to set up from the start. Remember to change the database settings in 'settings.py' accordingly.

Note: Regarding the bonus question, if you want to use the recommendation dataset, make sure to extract the .csv files and run the Cleanup.py file wherever they were extracted. The paths used in Cleanup.py will have to be changed, for it to work. Also, use your new paths in Database_Populate.py to install the records of the newly created cleaned-up files.
